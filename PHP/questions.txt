 Questions:

2) List the top 3 things you like about Laravel
3) For service providers, what is the difference between boot() and register()?
4) Present a scenario (or more) where you would create ServiceProvider for your app and NOT use those already provided by Laravel
5) List some Laravel packages you have used recently and that you liked working with
6) Present some techniques to organize a Laravel application as to be loosely coupled with the framework.
7) Given the overhead they introduce why would you use Blade components instead of including sub-views?


Answers:

1) For smaller projects, it's too big of a hustle. On some smaller projects, I prefer NOT to use Laravel/Symphony. Overwhelming, you have to search and read a lot of 
documentation if you want to know exactly the best route to take for the development process. Pretty difficult deployment, somewhat very different from plain PHP 
(Syntax point of view). A little old perhaps for the rapid development of the Backend technologies.

2) Very easy to create API applications (create a Model, add the Route and Controller in api.php and that's it ). It has a lot of packages like Socialite to include and
to ease the development. Easy to create MVC patterns

3) The register() method is used to register the classes or interfaces to the service container, while the boot() function is used to perform the afterward setup
(I.e. creating the routes )

4) For example, when needed to create custom validation rules that are not available via validators.

5)  I have used Socialite for a smaller client to authenticate via Social Media. Passport for Bear Authorization token and that's it

6) Segregate Database classes, so you can use more DBMS (like MySQL or Postgres).

7) Easier to scale and cleaner development, I guess. 

Disclaimer: (I DO NOT HAVE SUCH A BIG EXPERIENCE WITH LARAVEL) but I can always adapt and learn more ;)
